      Fluent Bit is an open-source, lightweight and extensible log data processor developed by Fluentd Inc. It is designed to collect, process, and forward log data in a distributed system, making it easier to manage and analyze large amounts of log data.
      Fluent Bit uses a pluggable architecture that allows it to collect data from a variety of sources, including files, network sockets, container logs, and operating system logs. It provides a simple and efficient way to filter and transform log data, allowing administrators to extract the information they need and discard irrelevant data.
      Fluent Bit includes a number of output plugins for forwarding data to a variety of destinations, including Elasticsearch, Kafka, and Amazon S3. It also includes support for buffering and batching, ensuring that data is transmitted efficiently and reliably.
      Fluent Bit is often used in conjunction with other tools for log management and analysis, including Fluentd and Elasticsearch. Its lightweight and efficient design make it a popular choice for managing log data in a distributed system.
